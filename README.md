## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a **Pharmacy Management System** developed as part of my 12th-grade Computer Science project. The application is written in **C++** and facilitates basic **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations to manage pharmacy inventory and transactions.

## Features

- **Medicine Inventory Management**: Add, view, update, and delete medicine records.
- **Customer Management**: Maintain customer information and purchase history.
- **Billing System**: Generate invoices for purchases.
- **Search Functionality**: Search medicines by name or ID.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Console-based menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Storage**: File handling using text/binary files
- **Development Environment**: Turbo C++ / Dev C++ (or any standard C++ compiler)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ferrindsouza/pharma_mgt_system.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```bash
